 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Nyamosi's Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my tech journey not in a classroom or a coding bootcamp, but on the couch, captivated by hacking scenes in movies—those dramatic moments where someone tapped a few keys and suddenly had access to the world. It wasn’t just the thrill of it that drew me in; it was the curiosity. How does that actually work? That question led me down a rabbit hole into the world of cybersecurity, programming, and eventually, web development.

As I dug deeper, what began as a fascination quickly became a passion. I wanted to understand everything—from how systems are built to how they’re broken into. I taught myself web development from the ground up, learning both front-end and back-end technologies, but always keeping cybersecurity at the core of everything I built. Along the way, I discovered another passion: teaching. I started creating tech content to share what I was learning, helping others understand this world that had opened up to me through curiosity and code.

But like many people in tech, I found myself pulled toward the “safe path”—a traditional job, stability, predictable steps. Yet something in me never settled. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was leaving something behind—something that mattered. I had dreams of building my own product, of creating tools that were both useful and secure. But I let them sit on the back burner.

Now, that fire is back—and it's stronger than ever. I’m streamlining my content, shifting focus, and making space to finally pursue that dream. Not just to build for the sake of building, but to create something real—something secure, something impactful. It’s time to get uncomfortable again. It’s time to take that leap.

My name is Nyamosi. I’m a developer, a cybersecurity advocate, a teacher—and I’m coming for everything younger me dreamed of.
